Notes on 802.11a/g implementation
  * modem: 16-QAM and 64-QAM are compatible with liquid-dsp
  * modem: BPSK seems backwards, map: {0,1} > {1,0}
  * modem: QPSK also backwards, map: {0,1,2,3} > {3,1,2,0}
  * pilot sequence: same as data scrambler: m-sequence: m=7, g=0x91, a=0x7f (n=127)

Notes on building:
  * when re-archiving, occasionally the following error message arises:
    
    ld: in libliquid-802-11.a(!<arch>
    #1/20), corrupt archive, member contents extends past end of file for architecture x86_64
    collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

  Solution: delete the archive (libliquid-802-11.a) and try again. Must
  be a problem with re-archiving; not sure of reason.

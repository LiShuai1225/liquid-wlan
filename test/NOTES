Notes on WLAN 802.11a/g implementation
  * modem: 16-QAM and 64-QAM are compatible with liquid-dsp
  * modem: BPSK seems backwards, map: {0,1} > {1,0}
  * modem: QPSK also backwards, map: {0,1,2,3} > {3,1,2,0}
  * internal modem methods now handle BPSK/QPSK mapping
  * pilot sequence: same as data scrambler: m-sequence: m=7, g=0x91, a=0x7f (n=127)
  * from initial benchmarking and profiling trials, it appears that the 
    majority of processing lies in the interleaver with integer 
    division. Since there are only eight symbol intereleaving 
    possibilities (one for each rate), we can probably store them in 
    some sort of structured look-up table.

To do:
  * fix bug with generating/synchronizing frames with rate 9 Mbits/s 
    (802.11a specification is vague with regards to frame length).
  * integrate certain components to within library (fft, etc.)

Wish list:
  * fixed-point implementation (liquid-fpm) for more efficient 
    processing

Troubleshooting/notes on building:
  * when re-archiving, occasionally the following error message arises:
    
    ld: in libliquid-wlan.a(!<arch>
    #1/20), corrupt archive, member contents extends past end of file for architecture x86_64
    collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

  Potential solution: delete the archive (libliquid-wlan.a) and try
  again. Must be a problem with re-archiving; not sure of reason.

  Tracked problem to src/libliquid_wlan.c; removed from build and
  everything seemed to work ok. Not sure why.

Notes on WLAN 802.11a/g implementation
  * modem: 16-QAM and 64-QAM are compatible with liquid-dsp
  * modem: BPSK seems backwards, map: {0,1} > {1,0}
  * modem: QPSK also backwards, map: {0,1,2,3} > {3,1,2,0}
  * pilot sequence: same as data scrambler: m-sequence: m=7, g=0x91, a=0x7f (n=127)

To do:
  * fix bug with generating/synchronizing frames with rate 9 Mbits/s 
    (802.11a specification is vague with regards to frame length).
  * integrate certain components to within library (modem, fec, etc.)

Wish list:
  * fixed-point implementation (liquid-fpm) for more efficient 
    processing
  * add benchmarking tool

Troubleshooting/notes on building:
  * when re-archiving, occasionally the following error message arises:
    
    ld: in libliquid-wlan.a(!<arch>
    #1/20), corrupt archive, member contents extends past end of file for architecture x86_64
    collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

  Potential solution: delete the archive (libliquid-wlan.a) and try
  again. Must be a problem with re-archiving; not sure of reason.

  Tracked problem to src/libliquid_wlan.c; removed from build and
  everything seemed to work ok. Not sure why.
